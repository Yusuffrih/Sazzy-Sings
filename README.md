### Design Decisions

When designing the website, I carried out some market research to see what the general design choices for similar websites. I carried out [Google](https://www.google.com) searches to see if I could find websites which provided a similar service that I could take some inspiration from. As part of my research, I found that there was generally a bright, almost Spring time theme which was sleek and attractive throughout. This was in keeping with the wedding theme.

#### Fonts 

When deciding the fonts that I would use on this website, I searched through Google Fonts to see if there were any fonts that looked attractive and sleek and that would look good when styled. I chose the **Cormorant Garamond** font due to its nice, stylish look which I though suited the sites look and feel. I decided have used Sans-Serif as a backup font in case Google Fonts does not work for any reason. 

#### Icons

Icons used in this project were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Icons were used to style the links to the social media pages and contact information in the footer. Some icons were also used to help illustrate the pricing section on the booking page.   

#### Colours

When deciding what the colour scheme of my website would be, I did some research as mentioned above. I visited websites that had a similar purpose/goal to this one, Wedding Singers websites e.g. [https://weddingsinger.ie](https://weddingsinger.ie/). As previously mentioned, weddings generally tend to be themed with bright colours. This drove the decision around what the colour scheme would be, while being cognisant to keep it simple and not distracting from the content. 

**font colours:**
* H1: I chose #535657, a navy colour which contrasted very well with the white marbled background image I chose to have throughout the website. 
* H2:  

I visited Coolors to find a colour scheme which matched what I wanted for the site. 



#### Images

The images used were original and were uploaded from my hardrive.



#### Wireframes

## Features

* A beautiful and effictive navigation through a navbar across each of the pages on the site. 
* A pretty, almost floral design that will remind the user of a wedding setting.
* A booking form which allows the prospective customer to contact the site owner easily. 
* Links to the site owners social media pages through slick Font Awesome icons. This is a important as the site owner has a lot of content here which will give the prospective customers an in-depth view of the potential of the service provided in addition to what is on the website.  
* The site email in case the site visitor wants to contact the site owner and not make a booking. These are also displayed with Font Awesome icons. 
* A beautiful hero image of the site owner across the home page giving the site visitors positive emotions from the moment they land on the page. 
* Youtube video of the site owner displayed on the home page so that the site visitors can instantly see the service they will be paying for. 
* Audio file teasers of the music that will be sung at their weddings. 
* Responsive, mobile first layout that also looks great on tablets and desktops. This was done by using bootstrap's grid layout.
* Bootstrap buttons used to make a booking once the form is filled in. Bootstrap buttons to bring the site user to the 'Songs' page from 'Home'. 
* An 'About Me' page which gives the potential customers an insight into what kind of person the site owner is as well as the previous work she has done as a singer and what the main achievements are.
